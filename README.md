<h1>RFM Analysis on Superstore Data</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
This project performs RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on Superstore data to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The goal is to identify key customer segments to improve targeted marketing strategies and enhance customer retention.
<h3>Introduction</h3>
RFM analysis is a proven marketing model for customer segmentation. It considers three quantitative factors:
<ul>
<li><b>Recency:</b> How recently a customer made a purchase.</li>
<li><b>Frequency:</b> How often a customer makes a purchase.</li>
<li><b>Monetary:</b> How much money a customer spends on purchases.</li></ul>
By scoring customers on these factors, we can segment them into different groups for targeted marketing efforts.
